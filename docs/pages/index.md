# Crestic

Crestic is a simple wrapper around the excellent backup tool [restic](https://restic.net/). 

Restic is fast, secure, and incredibly capable — 
but once you need to back up several folders to multiple destinations, 
its CLI can quickly become repetitive and hard to manage.

Crestic makes this easier. You define all your repositories and backup jobs 
in a single configuration file and run them with simple commands.
No hidden logic or magic — just more convenience and fewer chances 
to mess things up while using restic

## Native features of restic

-	Incremental deduplicated backups — minimal space usage
-	End-to-end encryption
-	Multiple storage backends — local, SFTP, AWS S3, Backblaze B2, rclone remotes, etc.
-	Snapshot-based system with automatic pruning policies
