# Crestic

Crestic is a simple wrapper around the excellent backup tool [restic](https://restic.net/).

Restic is fast, secure, and incredibly capable —
but once you need to back up several folders to multiple destinations,
its CLI can quickly become repetitive and hard to manage.

Crestic makes this easier. You define all your repositories and backup pipelines
in a single configuration file and run them with simple commands.
No hidden logic or magic — just more convenience and fewer chances
to mess things up while using restic.
